\title{Filter the L1000 Signature}
\usage{
filter_signature(signature, direction = "any", threshold = NULL, prop = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{signature}{A dataframe with the L1000 signature}

\item{direction}{Direction to filter to. Must be one of "up", "down" or "any". Defaults to "any"}

\item{threshold}{A Log Fold-Change Threshold to filter at. This can either be a single value
or a vector of two values. If a single value is given, then it is assumed to be a symmetric threshold.
If two values are given, then the first value is the down-regulated threshold and the second value is
the up-regulated threshold. Cannot be specified with prop}

\item{prop}{A proportion of genes to take from top and bottom. Cannot be specified with threshold}
}
\value{
a tibble with the filtered L1000 Signature
