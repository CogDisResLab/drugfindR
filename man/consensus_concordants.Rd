\arguments{
\item{...}{One or Two (see paired) Data Frames with the concordants}

\item{paired}{Logical indicating whether you split the dataframes by up and down regulated in prior analysis}

\item{cutoff}{A similarity cutoff value. Defaults to 0.321}

\item{cell_line}{A character vector of Cell Lines you are interested in.}

\item{discordant}{Logical indicating whether you want discordant signatures}
}
\value{
A tibble with the filtered and deduplicated results
}
\description{
This function takes a list of (optionally split) concordance dataframes and returns
